# [astroSharedState](https://astrosharedstate.netlify.app/)
Simple React, SolidJS, Svelte, &amp; Vue counter components with state &amp; shared state in Astro

Usage:
```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

Feel free to use this as a template if you'd like to weave together multiple frameworks in Astro, or if you're incrementally updating your site from one framework to another. For my purposes, it was intended to improve my understanding of state, and to remind myself why I don't use Vue.
